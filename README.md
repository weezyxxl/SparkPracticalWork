# Spark Practical Work. Big Data (MUII 2017)

The objective of this work is to develop a Spark application that
creates a machine learning model for a real-world problem, using real-world data: 
Predicting the
arrival delay of commercial flights.

## The Problem
The basic problem of this exercise is to create a model capable of predicting the arrival delay
time of a commercial flight, given a set of parameters known at time of take-off. To do that,
students will use publicly available data from commercial USA domestic flights. The main result
of this work will be a Spark application, programmed to perform the following tasks:

● Load the input data, previously stored at a known location.

● Select, process and transform the input variables, to prepare them for training the model.

● Perform some basic analysis of each input variable.

● Create a machine learning model that predicts the arrival delay time.

● Validate the created model and provide some measure of its accuracy.

## The Data
For this exercise, students will use data published by the US Department of Transportation. This
data can be downloaded from the following URL:

http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html

The dataset is divided into several independent files, to make download easier. You do not need
to download and use the entire dataset. A small piece should be sufficient, one that fits in your
development environment and does not take too long to process. The Spark application you
develop, however, should be able to work with any subset of this dataset, and not be limited to a
specific piece.

## Forbidden variables
The dataset consists of a single table with 29 columns. Some of these columns must not be
used, and therefore need to be filtered at the beginning of the analysis. These are:

● ArrTime

● ActualElapsedTime

● AirTime

● TaxiIn

● Diverted

● CarrierDelay

● WeatherDelay

● NASDelay

● SecurityDelay

● LateAircraftDelay

These variables contain information that is unknown at the time the plane takes off and,
therefore, cannot be used in the prediction model.

## Allowed variables
Any other variable present in the dataset, and not included in the previous list, can be used for
the model.

## Target variable
The target variable for the prediction model will be ArrDelay.
